# QuantumSimulation
Summer 18 project
We were required to make a Quantum Simulation( time evolving ) wavefunction for a given random potential.
Initialize potential in potential.txt and initialize a file Psi_0.txt with initial wave function.
1. Hamiltonian.py
2. waveFunc.py
3. plot_waveFunc.py

For Eigenvalues eVals.py
For Eigen functions eFuncs.py
